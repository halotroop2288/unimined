# Remapper Plugin for Unimined

This Unimined plugin provides a Patcher for source and class remapping
via [UML] (Unimined Mappings Library).

All the supplied mappings are compiled into one file before being applied to every applicable file,
including of course the game's files and other mods your project depends on.

Several formats are supported, including ones that you might not expect.
Such as AccessTransformer, AccessWidener, and Interface Injections.
