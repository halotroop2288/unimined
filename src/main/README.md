# Unimined API

For plugin developers! This provides APIs to:

- Implement Unimined on new platforms (such as Gradle, Maven, IDEA, Eclipse, or even a standalone version?)
- Add new patchers (i.e. mod loaders, modding environments, anything that modifies game or library files)
- Add new [UML]-supported mappings sources (such as MCP, Mojmap, Yarn, AccessWidener, Interface Injector, etc.)

Several built-in plugins for Minecraft modding can be found in adjacent directories.

Other official plugins exist for legacy modding environments, other games, etc.
